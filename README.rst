This is a simple gui library built using clutter, along with a test application which uses it.

This was created to checkout the clutter library.

It provides some simple widgets like a Label, ImageButton, ListBox (of image buttons).

It supports scrolling of the listbox and itemclick call back.

TODO:

Moving mouse beyond the ListBox's area will lead to any applied blur effect to persist beyond
the scroll. One needs to use a timeout logic to clear the blur effect if any applied during
scroll.
